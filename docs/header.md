# geometric_lib for Python 3
An amazing library, designed to efficiently and with incredible speeds carry out numerous geometric operations, while also being very compact, having the total size 100s of times less that alternatives.

Actually started as a student project, but exponentially expanded at some point (nearly 2 times more code!) and became what it is now.
